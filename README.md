# Play Sports Network Frontend Development Task
## Update to navigation on globalcyclingnetwork.com for mobile view
I have replicated the GCN homepage with a few tweaks to the navigation as detailed below. Further ideas that I did not have time to implement are also detailed below.  


### Summary of changes
* I have removed the buttons from the top red banner and replaced with text links as the buttons looked a bit crowded. 

### Further changes I would make with more time
* Landing page doesn't work well on mobile????? - disable scroll?
